# Loan-Approval-Prediction-ML

### Project Overview
Loan Approval Prediction System is a machine learning-based classification project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, and loan amount. The project includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation. Multinomial Naive Bayes was selected as the final model due to its perfect precision score, ensuring reliable loan approval predictions.

### Dataset Source : KAGGLE Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to loan applicants and is designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on multiple applicant attributes. Each row represents a unique loan application, and the columns describe the applicant’s personal, financial, and loan-related details.The dataset features represent applicant demographics, financial stability, and loan characteristics, including personal details.

### Approach

&#9679; Loaded and explored the loan approval dataset using Pandas.

&#9679; Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns.

&#9679; Handled missing values to maintain data consistency.

&#9679; Converted categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.

&#9679; Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

&#9679; Trained multiple machine learning classification models.

&#9679; Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

&#9679;Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### Results

&#9733; Accuracy : 98%
&#9733; Precision-Score : 0.98
